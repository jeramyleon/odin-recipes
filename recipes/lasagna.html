        <h3 class="par">Lasagna is a baked Italian dish made with layers of pasta sheets, sauce, and other ingredients, such as meat and cheese. The pasta is typically wide and flat, and can be ruffled. The dish can be made with tomato or white sauce, and fillings may include ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, and cheeses. The lasagna is then baked, and the resulting baked pasta is cut into square or rectangular portions. </h3>
