        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Pizza is a flat, round Italian dish that's made of thin, leavened wheat-based dough. The dough is topped with tomatoes and cheese, and sometimes other ingredients, like anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, and meat. It's then baked in a very hot oven, typically in a commercial setting. Pizza is usually served hot.</h3>
